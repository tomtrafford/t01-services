OPI Files
=========

All files under the opi/auto-generated folder will be generated by PVI at IOC runtime.

These files are not committed to git and any changes made to them will be lost when the related IOC is restarted.

To make custom opi files, create them in the opi root folder or other subfolders of opi.
