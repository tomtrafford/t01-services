OPI Files
=========

Hand coded OPI files can be added to this folder for access by phoebus.

The `auto-generated` folder is reserved for the auto generated engineering screens that IOCs generate using PVI. The auto-generated folder is not checked in to git and changes made there will be lost on IOC restart.
